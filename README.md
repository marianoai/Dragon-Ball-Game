## Theme
*Based on the famous [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball) of Akira Toriyama.*

> You are Goku, a powerful boy who travels in a magic cloud exploring the world in search of seven magic orbs known as the 'Dragon Balls', which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered.

## Game
The App reads the mobile phone accelerometer to get Goku moving. You have to move Goku to catch the seven balls.

### Usage
- Turn lightly the mobile phone to control the Goku's movement.
- Lead to Goku over a Dragon Ball and he'll catch it.
- Shake the mobile phone to re-start the game.
- When Goku get the seven Dragon Balls he will summon to Shenron - a wish-granting dragon.

### Score
1) You'll get points when Goku gets a Dragon Ball. Catch them soon and you'll get more points.

2) With each trapped ball, the difficulty is increased, so Goku will move faster and will be more difficult to control, but you'll get more points for catching the next ball.
